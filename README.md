# Hi there, you can call me Cambie ðŸ‘‹ 
### Cybersecurity Enthusiast, CTF Player & Skidware Analyst.

I used to work with CNC Machines, CAD and CAM software to design and develop mechanical parts.

Early 2022 I decided to get serious on Linux. A few months later I discovered Cybersecurity and I have not been able to stop learning since.
Currently, I'm interested in Red team operations, pentesting and both malware analysis and development.

In January 2025 I decided I would ship my own Linux Distribution and thats how I became the creator and mantainer of [MalbianLinux](https://github.com/MalbianLinux)

I used to and still do a lot of CTF challenges in order to sharpen my skills.
